# AI_Folder_Genie
A Super COOL Chrome Extension that Magically download files to the right folder!


I developed my first ever MVP, I named AI Folder Genie, it is a Chrome Extension that can automatically download files to the right folder. I am very excited about this product, since I wrote my own machine learning algorithm for it (hierarchical classification). Itâ€™s the first product I created that is useful to a lot of people, not limited to academia. Also, I am very proud of myself that I did it within a couple of weeks, and it has a very positive feedback so far from people who use it!


This is a project I did for my bootcamp. So I could only spend 2-3 wks on it. I would love to keep working on it once I got a job offer ^^. I am actively looking for machine learning engineer/data scientist positions!

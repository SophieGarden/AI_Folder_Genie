# AI_Folder_Genie
A Super COOL Chrome Extension that Magically download files to the right folder! A Browser Download Manager ^^


I developed my first ever MVP, I named AI Folder Genie, it is a Chrome Extension that can automatically download files to the right folder. I am very excited about this product, since I wrote my own machine learning algorithm for it (hierarchical classification). It’s the first product I created that is useful to a lot of people, not limited to academia. Also, I am very proud of myself that I did it within a couple of weeks, and it has a very positive feedback so far from people who use it!


This is a project I did for my bootcamp. So I could only spend 2-3 wks on it. I would love to keep working on it once I got a job offer ^^. I am actively looking for machine learning engineer/data scientist positions!

(I have been busy looking for jobs, so I will update the code, as well as instructions of how to install the Chrome Extension later)

See the demo pdf for details!

During my PhD in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I focused heavily on data analysis and computational modeling of laser optics. In particular, I developed physical models, which were then verified computationally by ensuring that simulated predictions agreed closely with real data I gathered. During this time, I became increasingly interested in machine learning, and realized that much of what I was doing aligned very closely with the type of modeling work that machine learning practitioners typically perform: gather data, try to develop a model to explain the data, and then evaluate the model in terms of how well it explains heretofore unseen data (in my case, data gathered in different laboratory conditions). I was delighted to find that much of the skills I developed during my time in academia lent themselves rather seamlessly to real-world machine learning problems encountered in the software domain.

However, developing models for data gathered in carefully controlled laboratory conditions versus models which must be robust in the wake of a relatively unpredictable user interactions are two very different things. I developed my first production-deployed machine learning system during my time as an Insight Fellow, when I wrote AI Folder Genie. Implemented as a Chrome extension, AI Folder Genie learns how users organize their files and recommends locations to store newly downloaded files based on contextual and file-specific features. I felt very impressed with myself when I was able to complete the MVP in a mere two weeks, as the modeling portion required natural language processing techniques in order to extract text features, and hierarchical classification techniques in order to make good predictions down users’ directory trees, thereby alleviating them of the manual tedium of navigating to the correct folder via searching and clicking (especially annoying on MacOS). However, it took longer to obtain consistent positive feedback from users, as this required making the product perform well under adversarial usage patterns and to develop careful automatic monitoring and sane fallbacks when the straightforward application of the learned model could give a bad user experience. Since then, I have been primarily interested in understanding: how do we unlock to great potential of machine learning techniques to augment our lives in a way that a) relieves users of manual tedium, and b) requires minimal developer effort? I believe solutions to these sorts of problems are extremely valuable as they have the highest gradient pointed in the direction of making machine learning reliable across a variety of problems. At the point of general reliability, machine learning can be ubiquitous in our lives and allow us to direct our attention on other big problems the world is facing.
